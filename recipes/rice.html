        <h2>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter.</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Finely grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>Ground turmeric</li>
                <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>Brown sugar</li>
                <li>Fine salt</li>
                <li>Basmati rice</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Walnuts</li>
                <li>Green onions</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.</li>
                <li>Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions.</li>
            </ol>
